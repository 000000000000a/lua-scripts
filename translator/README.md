## Steps

1. Visit https://passport.yandex.com/registration?origin=translate and make an account
2. Visit https://translate.yandex.com/developers/keys

4. Enter some random bullshit as the description and click "Create" https://i.imgur.com/vmuoGNp.png
5. Hover over the code field and press "Copy" https://i.imgur.com/cBoxlYf.png
6. Load the lua and type "set_api_key \<your copied key\>" in the console and press enter

If everything went well you should be able to use the translation now, if the lua says some bullshit like "invalid api key", just redo the steps.
