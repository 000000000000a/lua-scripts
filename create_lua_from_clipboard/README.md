This lua allows you to create a lua file using the content of your clipboard. Simply load the lua, copy any lua code to your clipboard and press the "create lua from clipboard" button thats located in the "Lua" groupbox in the "misc" tab.

With the console command "mv" you can rename the previously created lua, simply type "mv <current_file> <new_file>" in the console.
For example

```
[gamesense] Created jaifpqlcrykuongj.lua
] mv jaifpqlcrykuongj.lua new_file.lua
[gamesense] successfully renamed jaifpqlcrykuongj.lua to new_file.lua
```

With the console command "ls" you can see all the file's you've created in the current session.
For example
```
] ls
[gamesense] jaifpqlcrykuongj.lua
[gamesense] otjvipgyqnrwywdz.lua
[gamesense] igkkhfjaezcmumvp.lua
[gamesense] ijawckzchgqcjzec.lua
